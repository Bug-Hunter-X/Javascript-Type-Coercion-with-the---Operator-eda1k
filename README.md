# Javascript Type Coercion Bug
This example demonstrates a common error in Javascript related to type coercion and the + operator.
When using the + operator with a mix of numbers and strings, Javascript will perform string concatenation instead of numerical addition.
This can lead to unexpected results and bugs in your code.
The solution involves explicit type checking or using other operators such as - * or / for numerical operations.
